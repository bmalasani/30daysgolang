## GO Tools

### Workspace
A workspace is specified by a go.work file that specifies a set of
module directories with the "use" directive. These modules are used as
root modules by the go command for builds and related operations.  A
workspace that does not specify modules to be used cannot be used to do
builds from local modules


```
    go work

    edit        edit go.work from tools or scripts
	init        initialize workspace file
	sync        sync workspace build list to modules
	use         add modules to workspace file

```


## Module

Note that support for modules is built into all the go commands,
not just 'go mod'. For example, day-to-day adding, removing, upgrading,
and downgrading of dependencies should be done using 'go get'.
See 'go help modules' for an overview of module functionality.

Usage:

	go mod <command> [arguments]

The commands are:

	download    download modules to local cache
	edit        edit go.mod from tools or scripts
	graph       print module requirement graph
	init        initialize new module in current directory
	tidy        add missing and remove unused modules
	vendor      make vendored copy of dependencies
	verify      verify dependencies have expected content
	why         explain why packages or modules are needed


### Go tools

Go is a tool for managing Go source code.

Usage:

	go <command> [arguments]

The commands are:

	bug         start a bug report
	build       compile packages and dependencies
	clean       remove object files and cached files
	doc         show documentation for package or symbol
	env         print Go environment information
	fix         update packages to use new APIs
	fmt         gofmt (reformat) package sources
	generate    generate Go files by processing source
	get         add dependencies to current module and install them
	install     compile and install packages and dependencies
	list        list packages or modules
	mod         module maintenance
	work        workspace maintenance
	run         compile and run Go program
	test        test packages
	tool        run specified go tool
	version     print Go version
	vet         report likely mistakes in packages
